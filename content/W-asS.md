*It's GPT all the way down*

Most companies offering LLM wrappers should be bootstrapped and attain high margin from day 1 netting their creators a quick win.

They should be viewed as arbitrage opportunities between the value of the output they provide and the token cost they consume to provide such output. Fundamentally, they will have little to no differentiation, unless they can be the tool in a [come for the tool, stay for the network](https://caminmccluskey.medium.com/book-summary-the-cold-start-problem-andrew-chen-25f61f4d66b#:~:text=ultimate%20trajectory.-,Come%20for%20the%20Tool%2C%20Stay%20for%20the%20Network,-Initially%20attract%20users) play. The good ones will be copied by competitors quickly, degrading margins. The great ones will be folded into the product suite of foundation models.

Most of the low hanging fruit will disappear quickly. The stuff a lot of people want to do frequently, like asking questions about a document or writing cold outbound emails, will be offered by services which have top of funnel distribution. Google docs will let you ask questions, Apollo.io ~~will~~ does let you write email sequences using an AI assistant etc.
## So what opportunities **are** available?

There are a long tail of high value AI use-cases where domain knowledge is required to spot and take advantage. Still, the question remains - why wouldn't the players already serving such customers take advantage of their top of funnel to create their own GPT wrapper? 

*Couple of points I'd like to continue to make*
1. ^ they don't have the technical ability to make it happen and wrapping would provide such outsized adv. (10x) that you could break through
2. Opps where the customer service are the differentiated advantage
3. When is wrapping not enough?
5. GPT Wrappers as a Service - wrappers of wrappers (the y-combinator of gpt wrappers) - ==main idea==


What you need to create a quick win
1. Either
	1. Distribution + marginally better customer experience using a GPT wrapper
		1. not relevant for most 
	2. (with no distribution adv) 10x better customer experience using a GPT wrapper
		1. accept fast followers
	3. (with no distribution adv - by implication) An opportunity to create a new category of service by virtue of GPT 
		1. Accept fast followers & foundational model impingement
		2. UNLESS come for the tool stay for the network
	4. (2 and particularly 3) With a viable fine tuning narrative
		1. Attractive b/c data advantage with scale - data network effects (tbh I need to clarify my thinking on what this means when differing to GPT wrappers)
		2. This is possible with OpenAI - [fine tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/when-to-use-fine-tuning)

3 sides to worry about
1. Incumbents (non-ai enabled) with distribution advantage
2. Foundation model companies expanding their core offering
3. Fast followers taking advantage of an undifferentiated product

You need to ferret out a space which is (mostly) safe from all 3 and once you have conceptualised that, ask if it's venture scale. My hunch is likely no??

OR, and this is my main point. You could not play the game at all. You could be the company that creates the companies. Still, isn't this vulnerable to foundation models? Already tools like https://aiagent.app/ are hitting this space. Allowing customers to create AI agents bespoke to their use case. 

==However, I think the opportunity will reside in the legacy companies and domain, mostly untouched by software even. Like cell phones leapfrogging landlines, there are industries that never made the switch to software that perhaps now can.==
