> We were promised flying cars and instead got 128 characters - Peter Thiel

People have posited many reasons for why all the innovation over the last several decades has, with rare exception come in the world of bits.

One explanation that I haven't heard put forward but which, at least from my vantage point appears to be true, is that **anyone entering a "traditional" engineering (read: non comp-sci) degree programme lacks any positive ambition to actually be an engineer when they leave, much less to start a company**. There is no shining example of a path to follow, the experience sucks during and the prospects look grim after.

It seems they have a horrible time during their studies and could think of nothing worse than continuing on this path when they leave. This is most likely compounded by the fact the economic prospects are worse than a career moving bits (of the computer or money variety) around in Silicon Valley or Wall St.

## The Big Picture
The social network was a catalyst for many would-be entrepreneurs, including myself. Despite painting a rather sad (and mostly untrue) tale of a lonely nerd who pissed off his only friend and lost the girl, it was an eye opener to what a career *could* look like. Hacking into the night , moving to Silicon Valley, showing up to meetings in pyjamas. Mostly it made it all very real that the product I'm using, my friends and family are using was made by a very small team with no formal qualification and no **permission** to do so.

Where is the equivalent cultural touchstone that's encouraging tomorrow's entrepreneurial talent to set aside their MacBook and pick up a pipette? 

## The Smaller Picture
Perhaps the next generation doesn't need a blockbuster film, in the same way a Social Network [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accidental_Billionaires) didn't, and couldn't have resonated quite as much. Kids these days are more likely to be influenced, for better or worse, by their peers on social media. There's some good news on that front. There are plenty of influencers who are admirably demonstrating what they're building in the physical world. 

On the flip side, software engineering influencers are also numerous (theprimeagen, mylene, roxcodes, teejdev to name a few). What strikes me as interesting is that these folks, for the most part, seem interested in doing *something* with their projects. Getting them out into the world as products or freely available libraries. And perhaps that's an artefact of how easy it is to distribute software.

This is why it's super important for videos like this one (varda space) to exist.

## The overall picture 
*(i.e. this is a mostly joking but maybe kind of not explanation)*
- Traditional engineering is hard and VC is miscalibrated
