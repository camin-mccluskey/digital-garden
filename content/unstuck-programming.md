A collection of techniques I find helpful for getting unstuck when thinking through hard problems, in programming and elsewhere. 

1. Start with the API
2. Write more - almost indiscriminately write down everything that comes to mind as you think through the problem. Pause. Edit as if you need to present your problem to someone else
3. Take the problem to a new space - think through the problem graphically or pictorially
	1. In particular - take the problem into discrete state space. What possible states can there be? What determines the transition between them?
4. Create a toy example first - strip away the particulars and find the essence of the hard thing. Solve that, then layer the complexity back on
5. Remove constraints
	1. Somewhat like the toy example but rather than removing the redundant detail, remove critical constraints like time or memory complexity. What does the completely naive solution
6. Avoid the midwit solution. Try the dumb one.
	1. Like the naive solution except in this situation purposely seek out the most obvious solution. Ideally the one a layperson might suggest, if asked on the spot
