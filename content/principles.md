2022/23 was a period of incredible highs and massive lows. Through that period and after a good deal of reflection I realised I was working and living without much of a North Star. I didn't ask enough questions when things were working well and I didn't speak up vocally enough when they weren't. I assumed others knew better than me how to evaluate the trajectory of my own life. 

I realise I need to have habits and principles I can rely on. Ones that I alone choose, in aspiration, to live by. **Principles** that I refuse to violate and **habits** that allow me to live by those principles to the best of my ability.

# Principles

1. Work **only** with with people I [[cofounder-respect|trust deeply]]
2. Celebrate small wins
3. Be open about the journey 
4. Build faster by scoping down and focusing only on what really matters (micro-focus)
5. Take time to consider the whole picture, don't get lost in the weeds (macro-focus)

# Habits

1. I restrict my focus to the single biggest task every day
2. I exercise 3x times/week minimum
3. I stratify every day into "on" and "off" time
4. I take time to [[_index|write]] every day
5. I get > 6.5hrs sleep every night
