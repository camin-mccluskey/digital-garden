    - Do you want to be a streamer/content creator
        - Start Date? - First video __ready to upload__ - [[2023-01-20]]
        - 1 Year Goals? - 10k subs, weekly videos, confident in front of camera - [[2024-01-17]]
        - 3-5 creators you want to emulate?
            - Fireship
                - Emulate: Crisp and informative, short videos, great formats (weekly updates & 100s vids). Good mix of humour and education. Editing feels clean.
                - Differentiate: Create video series with more narrative. Go beyond technologies and apply them as well as business and startup advice
            - The Primegen
                - Emulate: Funny, really knowledgable, amazing editing - content feels exciting 
                - Differentiate: Tangents get boring - stay on topic. Too ADHD for my liking. A little too advanced for a mainstream audience - too much focus on performance over "real" projects. Less techy more startupy. Not actually that educational - the streams at least.
            - Jeff Wittek
                - Emulate: Confidence, Funny, Aspirational, Keeps content fresh and exciting. Inventing formats that feel genuine
                - Differentiate: Too much of an asshole character - that wouldn't be genuine for me. I can be more self-deprecating.
            - ==Takeaways== - humour, education and humour in roughly equal portions. Confidence. Build video by video. Mix business and tech - I'm not sure anyone is really doing this (maybe Ben Awad but his content feels a bit meh, he doesn't really follow through in the way I'd like him to)
    - 6.9M streamers each month (in 2022) - this is only Twitch alone. Only 0.66% make Twitch Partner. The odds of "success" are very low.
    - Avg. viewers of 1k on YT  - $2k (streaming not videos - very different)
    - How do you stream
        - Streams are recordings 
        - Streaming vs. Youtube Videos
            - Built in growth mechanism
            - Permanence gauges success better
            -  Structured format = Better content
            - Every video is a lottery ticket
        - How to stream for YT 
            - Introduce ideas -> Meat and Potatoes -> Conclusion
            - Mr Beast is the best at introductions
            - Steaks are absolutely key to an intro to an idea - the stakes should be increasing
        - If you stream for YT it's easy to edit
        - You can/should stream for the sake of it but going live for 8hrs with no plan won't grow the stream
    - ==Form ideas around video titles==
    - 3 Ways to Grow
        - Collabs - you need to have a bedrock of content first
        - Outside Traction - of course cross-post to YT, TikTok etc but aim to blow up in a smaller community (Reddit, Twitter, Discord groups etc - be authentic)
        - Big Events - really good content is above everything else. Hype up the stream/video
    - Think of Ideas that Work for you
        - Don't waste time on ideas that you can't do - you can't give money away, you aren't already a big famous
    - What do you Stream?
        - Do what everyone else is doing - make your own version of what is popular
        - Look at 3-5 creators you want to emulate?
        - Throw shit at the wall - eventually something will stick - double down on that while exploring idea space
        - At a certain point growth becomes more about consistency than creativity - Reckful
- ==Thumbnails are key - make them first - you need to stand out from the crowd==
- Video Plan
    - What can I create videos about
        - Startups 
        - Personal Motivation
        - Technology / Programming
    - Research niches
        - I think the missing part of the tech YT niche is real startup CTOs - as in equally interested in building the product and the business. All the creators I know of fall too far on the spectrum (Justin Kan <==> ThePrimegen)
        - Look at Developer Filip - watched his first video and it was boring - he told me about the concept of building a platform then we looked at NextJS and the login flow for his app. 
            - What would make this better - snappy intro - emotional ups and downs
            - Map out the whole concept - I actually like the idea of coming up with the idea, or at least understanding how he did so 
                - There is so much I've learned from EF and Sequoia that I could impart here
            - Talk about validation - what will I do to validate the idea first (before any coding)
            - Talk about an MVP - can I do this with no code, low code
            - Talk about how to find users to test with
            - Talk about fleshing out the "actual" product
            - .... there are so many steps
            - __Ideally this would be split into multiple videos - like a Netflix series for creating, validating, launching and growing a startup__
        - TheoGG could be this but he doesn't focus too much on the CEO side which idk why
    - Create customer personas for my videos - know your audience
        - College student - studying business or CS. Elite (or close to elite) college (US or UK). Interested in startups, potentially for some "right" and "wrong" reasons (money vs. impact). May or may not have the skills they need to build their idea. They will almost certainly fall into idea traps (no work exp yet)
        - Early career tech worker - early-mid 20's working at a startup (non-FANG). Wants to break free from their job and start a startup - they have the skills already but are going to fall into traps on the business side. They may have better ideas (b/c work exp) though.

                - don't start with ideas, start with problems
                - observe problems you have 
                - observe problems people you know well have 
                - focus on problems which people feel deeply - it's better to have 10 people love the product than 10000 that merely like it
                - focus on problems which are growing
                - look for problems which you are uniquely capable of solving
                - look for problems where there has been a step change in some technology that could be used to solve this problem
                    - look for clue in history
                - crispy define the problem by speaking with real customers
                    - find the early adopters - __this feels like it could be a different video__
                - explore the idea maze - the problem definition is just the entry to the maze
                - use linear ideation 
                - conceptual blockbusting
