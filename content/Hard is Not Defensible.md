- Summary: Hard is not defensible. You need something the snowballs to be definesible in business, especially in startups. Amazon's delivery network, Apple's design and brand, Google's datasets. Hard is merely a temporary roadblock for motivated competitors and the larger the opportunity the less of a roadblock. 



- Types of Hard
    - Math Hard
        - Something that is hard (or non-obvious at least) to figure out
        - This doesn't mean it's hard to understand or copy
        - Pythagoras had to think very hard to discover his theorem, now kids learn it in school. 
        - This sort of hard is not a defense, since it's very hard to keep things that work a secret, especially to motivated competitors
    - Bodybuilding Hard
        - Something that everyone knows how to do, but no one wants to do
        - [[Paul Graham]] calls this the the shlep factor is high
        - Again, not really a defense. If the rewards are sufficient
        - Bodybuilders use steroids to shortcut this hardness - startups use money. 
            - There is always a good chance someone will have more money than you.
- Building a Defensible Product
    - The only defense is doing something that scales, meaning no one else can catch up
    - Network effects, EOS, virality
