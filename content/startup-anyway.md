When I wrote about my mental model for ideation - [[ideation-flywheel|The Ideation Flywheel]] - I assumed, as one always must, that people might have some disagreements. 

I thought objectors would question something specific about the model, or even the idea that *any* mental model could help guide something as abstract as ideation. What surprised me was the number of comments expressing the notion that it's somehow *wrong* to want to start a company, as opposed to hacking together some project that magics itself into a company.

I realise this sentiment is quite common. Starting a startup is no longer counter-cultural, it's now cool. Starting with 'The Social Network', we saw young entrepreneurs in a new light. No longer awkward nerds, they were *rich* awkward nerds. And, like anyone with a friend who liked a band "before they were mainstream", those who were hacking away before tech founders were buying yachts and influencing elections resent the influx of people newly interested in founding a company.

I don't doubt that some, maybe even most, of these individuals are motivated by status or money rather than nobler ambitions. The thing is, I don't think that matters. If you solve a problem for someone and they're willing to pay you for it, who cares why you started out?
## Start anyway

Paul Graham famously advises not to worry about creating a company but rather to look for problems and create something useful to solve them. If you succeed, meaning others agree what you've created is useful, creating a company is the next logical step. I don't disagree with this, indeed I start with the exact same advice. 

However, I think the sentiment expressed above comes from interpreting this advice as meaning that you shouldn't even *consider* the opportunity cost of solving your chosen problem. It also assumes a problem is some known entity. The real world is messy; full of overdetermined systems, hidden information and revealed preferences. Problems are rarely as simple as they appear.

The reality is that the prizes for problem solving are not made equal. You should play games that pay to win. If not for yourself then for society. In general, the most societally valuable problems are the most financially valuable to solve.

Problems emerge -- ...

I also think this advice is somewhat a luxury belief for VCs that founders shouldn't internalise. 
## Is this just semantics 

Basically - what if we all agree but the issue is pinning down what we mean by problems, ideas and ideation.

You should be mission driven, the idea is not the pick problems with the highest EV - that's impossible to estimate anyway. You can backfill a business if you're solving a big enough challenge. However to think only of the problems and to limit yourself to a single problem is a mistake.

## Points to make above

1. **Who cares what your motivations are if you are successful in solving a problem** - You win, your customers win, and society wins. Failure is the modal outcome anyway, even for those with the most genuine of motivations.
2. **A problem is a starting point** - If you're solely interested in one particular problem you preclude yourself from discovering other, more valuable problems you might be ideally placed to solve. Incidentally this is the fundamental point of the ideation flywheel model.
3. If your passionately curious, and you must be, you will never be mulling over a single problem at any given point.
4. **Being flexible allows you to shoot for bigger outcomes** - 
5. Evidence - Reed Hastings, Travis Kalanac, any repeat entreprenuer. 
	1. WW2 plane - you don't see all the terrible ideas 
	2. Collison - you invent a retrospective narrative
6. **Action precedes motivation** - Another PG quote - "startups are like sharks, if they stop swimming they die." - https://x.com/StartupArchive_/status/1711746006465794294?s=20




## v2 - don't

If your **only** motivation is money or status. You're very likely to be sorely disappointed. Go work for a hedgefund. Even if you aren't certain to be disappointed, passion sustains and if you don't have passion for the problem (whatever it might be) you're

Motivation doesn't precede action, the direction of causality is backwards from your intuition.
