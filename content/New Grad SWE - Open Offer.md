If you have a new grad SWE role lined up, but are curious about starting a company, I have a risk-free proposal I'd like to offer you. 

1. **Take the grad role** - act like a sponge for the first 4-6 months. This is long enough for you to see how senior engineers operate, to see at least 1-2 projects go from conception to production, and to see how "good" software engineering happens at scale.
	2. This is also long enough, if you're sufficiently ambitious, to realise a promo cycle at any of these companies is at least 1yr (and longer for each promo thereafter). You'll also realise it's largely dependent on your team having the opportunities for you to own sufficiently a) complex b) impactful and c) cross-cutting projects. This is not a given and depends on factors you cannot control (company strategy, your manager's mood, the wider industry landscape - I was working at a flight search company during covid...)
2. **While working you're going to have ideas** - most of them are going to be bad but you should work to (in)validate them anyway. It's a valuable muscle to build. Hack together prototypes, do some customer development etc. 
3. **So here's the offer:**
	1. Schedule time with me (every 2 weeks, 45 mins, for 3 months) to talk about any/all of the following:
		1. How to validate your idea - Do people want it? Does it seem venture back-able (or bootstrap-able)? Does it seem like you have a differentiated insight?
		2. How to scope your MVP - no-code, low-code, some-code
		3. How to get set up to turn your idea into a business - legal, finance, tooling, etc...
		4. Whatever else you're curious about
	2. If things are going well, and you think you're ready to quit your job:
		1. If you want to go down this path - I'll help you with your EF application (and/or YC/others).
		2. I'll intro you to others who might be able to help - co-founders, early employees, investors
		3. I'll continue to be available for advice/a friendly face

Taking the job vs. starting a company doesn't need to be a one-or-the-other decision. Just don't use your company laptop and don't work on company time :)

If this seems interesting, send me a DM.
