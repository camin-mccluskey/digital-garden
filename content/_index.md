I am also the co-founder of an app for housemates -Â [inHouse](https://inhouseapp.io/). You can find me on TwitterÂ [@camin_mccluskey](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=camin_mccluskey)

This is my Digital Garden. A digital garden is XYZ. You can search across all notes using the search box (or using `cmd+k`) or by clicking on the graph view, backlinks or tags on this page. I use tags organise notes by concept with the exception of the following tags - `#seedling`,  `#sappling` and `#evergreen`:

- Seedlings:
- Sapplings:
- Evergreens: Densely connected, well fleshed out ideas.
