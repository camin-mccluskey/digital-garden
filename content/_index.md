I'm the Co-Founder & CTO ofÂ [Stackfix](https://stackfix.com). Before that I co-founded Telescope, an ML driven sales outreach platform and was a full stack software engineer at Skyscanner. You can find me on TwitterÂ [@camin_mccluskey](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=camin_mccluskey)

This is my Digital Garden - a combination of an online notebook and a personal wikipedia. You'll find mostly work-in-progress thoughts and ideas as they occur. I can't promise anything will be complete or well written but perhaps it might spark some interest. If you'd prefer to read only my "finished" writing you can find that on [Medium](https://caminmccluskey.medium.com/).

You can search across all notes using the search box (or using `cmd+k`) or by clicking on the graph view, backlinks or tags on this page. I use tags organise notes by concept with the exception of the following tags - `#seedling`,  `#sapling` and `#evergreen`:

- **Seedlings**: Random notes and thoughts as they occur. Mostly unconnected.
- **Saplings**: Starting to formulate a coherent pattern of thoughts, loosely connected with other ideas.
- **Evergreens**: Densely connected, well fleshed out ideas.

If you're not sure where to get started, I've back-linked a couple of short blogs that might serve as good jumping off points -->
