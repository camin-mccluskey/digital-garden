I'm the Co-Founder & CTO of [Stackfix](https://stackfix.com). Before that I co-founded Telescope, an ML driven sales outreach platform and was a full stack software engineer at Skyscanner. You can find me on Twitter [@caminmc](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=caminmc)

This is my Digital Garden - a combination of an online notebook and a personal wikipedia. You'll find mostly work-in-progress thoughts and ideas as they occur. I can't promise anything will be complete or well written but perhaps it might spark some interest. If you'd prefer to read only my "finished" writing you can find that on the Stackfix [Blog](https://stackfix.com/blog) and on [Medium](https://caminmccluskey.medium.com/).

You can search across all notes using the search box (or using `cmd+k`) or by clicking on the graph view, backlinks or tags on this page. I use tags to organise notes by concept with the exception of the following tags - `#seedling`,  `#sapling` and `#evergreen`:

- #seedling: Random notes and thoughts as they occur. Mostly unconnected.
- #sapling: Starting to formulate a coherent pattern of thoughts, loosely connected with other ideas.
- #evergreen: Densely connected, well fleshed out ideas.

If you're not sure where to get started, I've back-linked a couple of short blogs to this page that might serve as good jumping off points.
