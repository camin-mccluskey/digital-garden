Are there things we'd like to happen forever in the universe? Can we pay for these things to happen?

One obvious one would be to transcode your DNA*, or some other facet of your physical/mental being today and preserve it in perpetuity (or until some specified condition is met).

One might want to meet aliens or be reanimated, cloned, or mated with biotechnology when technology allows (or when reproductive cloning is made legal in some jurisdiction in some part of the universe).

One might want to send a message to some specific point in the future (say a great^n grandchild). 

*Indeed DNA storage is possibly the best way **to** store data - [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221007-how-to-store-data-for-1000-years) , [Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/dna-solution-permanent-data-storage-180954315/)
- it seems this place is saying we store DNA as-is, rather than encoding it in another medium

NovaSeq 6000 v1.5 - $600 per whole genome - prices falling faster than Moore's Law
DNA can be stored in liquid nitrogen or in dehydrated form for 1000's of years

3 Questions
- Is it legally possible/enforceable?
	- ["in perpetuity"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/in_perpetuity) has the precise legal meaning of forever. One can benefit from the profits of land *in perpetuity* or be granted a *perpetual* copyright.
	- It would [appear](https://privateequity.weil.com/glenn-west-musings/forever-long-time-no-time/#footnote-6) that the contract itself must stipulate that the term is indeed perpetual (rather than omitting an enddate) - [source](https://privateequity.weil.com/glenn-west-musings/forever-long-time-no-time/) 
	- The matter of *who* will enforce a perpetual contract  - in the timescale of millenia 
		- One would suppose the contract *itself* would need to stipulate that 
- Is it physically possible?
	- Again, the contract would stipulate that necessary upgrades and redundancies happen to ensure that the contract terms are upheld
	- However, if one were to make every reasonable effort
- How should one price such a contract?
	- Alcor charges $200k for a body and $80k for a brain alone. 
		- Most pay by making Alcor the beneificiaries of life insurance contracts
	- For example, Tomorrow Biostasis uses a non-profit partner organization called the Tomorrow Patient Foundation (TPF) to maintain your funds.Â 
		- 30-40% of the funds from the term life insurance are allocated to the TPF. The TPF puts these funds into very low risk investments that yield 1-2% above inflation covers the running costs of maintenance (e.g. liquid nitrogen).
		- [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryonics_europe/comments/nzj9bh/how_much_does_cryonics_cost/)
	- In the case of what we're referring to - we don't need to charge to cover most of the cost (standby medical teams, transport, cyropreservation or revival)
	- TomorrowBio stores their patients are non-profit organisations to shield them from changes in the company
	- In the 70's there were more cryonics companies, some of them went bankrupt - Alcor using more than half of their large fee to fund their "Patient Care Trust". https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html
