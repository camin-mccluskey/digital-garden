The Ideation Flywheel is a mental model to help you think about which startup ideas are worth pursuing and, more importantly, how to improve your ideas by testing without bias.

# 1. Focus on problems

The first step is forgetting about startup ideas entirely - thinking only in “idea space” is a surefire way to come up with solutions in need of problems or solutions for problems that don’t really exist.

So, how do we surface problems? This is actually pretty hard. For most of us, life is mostly good. The trick therefore, is to become someone that starts to notice problems. I know this sounds like reductive advice, but it's a necessary precondition to finding problems worth solving.

You can do this in various ways, including:

- Keeping a notebook or note in your phone to jot down when you notice something suboptimal.
- Looking back into your professional and personal life - think about your current job, your previous jobs, internships etc - what sticks out as particularly painful?
- Asking people you know - what are people *consistently* complaining about in the pub or around the dinner table?

The core theme in all of the above "tips" is to remain continuously curious.
# 2. Stack rank problems

Now you have a list of possible problems you could work on. How do you decide which among them is the best use of your time and resources?

You need some sort of rubric to grade them. You may want to rank the problems on the following characteristics:

- To what extent are you uniquely capable of solving this problem? Do you have an unfair advantage in solving this problem (access, knowledge, experience)?
- How confident are you that this market is large already or is *going* to be large at some point in the near future?
- How confident are you that there a path to monopoly in this market?
- What is the Miracle Count? How many big bets (miracles) do you think you'll need to pull off to have success solving this problem?
- How strong is your personal interest in this problem? Passion sustains you when things get hard. Pick problems you're passionate about.
- Has something fundamentally changed about the market landscape? E.g. new regulation.
- Has there been a step change in some technology that could be used to solve this problem? Be careful not to slip into solutionising yet, you might be wrong about this technology's suitability.
- Finally, upweight problems which are:
	- Frequent, painful and pervasive.
	- Felt sharply by a small number rather than somewhat felt by a large number (on the margin)

There is no "correct" way to grade problems for stack ranking. However, I would make sure that any problem you choose to work on scores highly on both:

1. **Market, or potential market, size** - [great markets pull products](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html) out of startups. 
2. **Your personal interest in the problem** - failure doesn't happen when you run out of money, it happens when you give up. Make sure you have enough interest to keep motivated through the inevitable ups and downs.

# 3. Crisply define the problem with **real** users

It’s very tempting, once you have decided on a problem, to jump in with all the possible solutions that come to mind. Hold that thought. You need to first really deeply understand the problem.

The only way to do that is to speak with actual people that have the problem. However, to gain a useful understanding you need to conduct these conversations in the correct way.

The single best resource to learn how to do this is called the [Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/) by Rob Fitzpatrick. I recommend you pick up a copy before you conduct a single interview but I’ll give you the overview here:

- You shouldn't ask anyone whether your business is a good idea. It's a bad question and invites everyone to lie to you at least a little.
- Talk about their life instead of your idea - the goal of the interview is to extract data about the problem, not to sell your eventual solution.
- Ask about specifics in the past instead of hypotheticals or opinions about the future.
- Understand the context around the problem - what was their path to encountering the problem? How does this problem interact with their life? What are their motivations for tackling the problem?
- Talk less and listen more - if you’re talking about your idea (or anything else) they aren’t talking about their problems - remember you’re there to learn.

# 4. Explore the idea maze

The first step into the [Idea Maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze/) is really understanding the problem. Hopefully, through your interviews, you will have built this understanding. Continuing to walk through the Maze is the essence of foundership because, in some sense, you’re never really out of the Maze.

So what do these early steps look like?

- Researching what possible solutions exist to the problem you now understand.
- Understanding the constraints of potential customers - budget, time, knowledge etc.
- Understanding how the Maze is changing over time - you want to navigate to where the ball is going to be.
- Understanding what a minimal feature set looks like to solve the core burning problem - you don’t have the luxury of years of development and tonnes of cash (and even if you did, you shouldn’t spend it now).
- Understand what a 10x improvement looks like - 10x is important - you are an unknown startup, it’s not enough to be just slightly better than the competition.
- Understanding how you can be *different* and not merely better - you need to be able to stand out in a crowded market - it’s good to have heretical views and seek to occupy an opposing position to incumbents. Bonus points if you set yourself up to do something they *cannot* do (e.g. because it would destroy their margins).

Your journey is going to be unique to you and your idea. However, I do want to share some tips generally applicable tips as you start out navigating the Idea Maze.

- Look for clues in history - it's highly unlikely you're the first person to try to solve this problem.
- Don’t be afraid of others in the Maze with you - learn what you can and recognise any problem worth solving is going to have many people trying to solve it.
- Some turns lead to dead ends - that’s fantastic news, it's simply a [[hypothesis-driven-startup|hypothesis]] debunked and wasted time avoided.

Now things can go 1 of 2 ways. The much more likely path is that, through your exploration, you conclude that this problem is not solvable (yet), not solvable for you, or perhaps not *worth* solving. This may be for a multitude of reasons. Maybe the timing is not right, maybe you are not the right person, maybe you have the skills but you realise you don’t have a burning passion to work on this problem for years on end, or maybe the market is smaller than anticipated. That’s all ok, it's actually to be expected. That’s why there is a stage 5 (or why this framework is a flywheel).

# 5. "Linear Ideation" (restart the flywheel)

Take what you’ve learned from your exploration and feed that back into the next round of ideation - but crucially, **do not** throw away your research. Retaining and using the knowledge and experience you've acquired is the principle of [linear ideation](https://medium.com/entrepreneur-first/how-to-pivot-properly-linear-ideation-5be605f37d04).

As you explored the idea maze you will have found other clues which might lead to an even greater treasure. Maybe you found new but related problems to add to your list of problems or maybe you found new information which impacts the stack ranking of your problems.

Above all, you will have contacts and experience in a problem domain through your research and your interviews which can be leveraged in the next round of ideation. Don’t start all over from scratch, preserve the value you’ve created in previous rounds of ideation to propel you to the next.
