- Quantum Computing for the Very Curious
    - Part I: The State of a Qubit
        - Classical computers use bits, which have a state which is either 0 or 1. For the most part programmers do not think about the physical manifestations of the bits, and just use an abstraction
        - Quantum computers use Quantum Bits (qubits)
            - Qubits also have a state but where the state of bit is a number (either 0 or 1) ==the state of a qubit is a vector in 2 dimensional vector space==
                - $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} $$
                - We call the 2 dimensional space where qubit state lives, "state space"
                - There's no real need to worry about what a qubit is, any more than you worry how bits are stored on your laptop. It's fine to treat it like a purely abstract mathematical concept
        - What's the relationship between classical bits and Quantum bits?
            - There are 2 special qubits states that correspond to the states of a classical bit
                - Classical: 0
                - Quantum: $$|0 \rangle: \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$$
                    - This special $$|0 \rangle$$ state is called a ==computational basis state==
                - Classical: 1
                - Quantum:  $$|1 \rangle: \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$$
                    - Again this is a computational basis state
        - The General States of a Qubit
            - The computational basis states are just 2 options for qubit state. e.g
            - Indeed this is what is so special about qubits, as opposed to classic bits
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fcamin%2FhYDSNhYpK1.png?alt=media&token=d9c3bf00-6c83-40d8-a5f4-f796c3be8d27)
            - Another way to describe this qubit state would be $$\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\ 0.8\end{bmatrix}$$
                - Why well 0.6*{1,0} + 0.8*{0,1} = {0.6, 0.8} in vector notation
            - Note that all the examples (the computation basis states and the example above) have shown only real valued vectors. In reality the qubit state can (and mostly is) a complex vector.
                - E.g. $$\frac{1+i}{2} |0 \rangle + \frac{i}{\sqrt2} |1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}  \frac{1+i}{2} \\ \frac{i}{\sqrt2}\end{bmatrix}$$
        - Superposition
            - People will say a state like $$0.6|0\rangle+0.8|1\rangle$$ is a __superposition__ of $$|0\rangle and |1\rangle$$
            - It's just a fancy word for linear combination in that sense
            - Another equivalent term for the coefficients of the states is "Amplitude"
                - In this example the amplitude for $$|0\rangle$$ is 0.6, for example
        -  Normalization Constraint 
            - Notice in every example (even the complex ones), there have been a very specific values for the coefficients
            - ==the sum of the squares of the amplitudes must be equal to 1==
            - i.e. if $$\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$ then $$|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$$
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fcamin%2FaYJz3HvufY.png?alt=media&token=9e39ae0e-f662-4f47-bce9-7f23475a3c80)
        - The Final Definition
            - Putting everything together we can now define what Part I: The State of a Qubit actually is
            - ==The quantum state of a qubit is a vector of unit length in a 2 dimensional complex vector space, known as a state space.==
        - Something to keep in mind 
            - The $$|0\rangle \neq 0$$
        - How Should we Think About Quantum States?
            - It's fairly easy to have an intuitive grasp on classical bits. There are holes (or no hole) on a punch card
            - Every classical bit if just a riff on this idea. Whether it's a switch or transistor turn off/on or a charge on a magnetic plate
            - It's harder to find an intuitive answer to the quantum state - so we will revisit when we have more mathematics on our side.
            - One thing to note is the idea of being "simultaneously" in both the $$|0\rangle$$ and $$|1\rangle$$ state at once. This doesn't really make sense. In general that's not how you think about a vector, it's not "simultaneously" one basis vector or the other, it just is where it is
    - Part II: Introducing Quantum Logic Gates
        - We want to build up the same fundamental logic gates we have in classical computing. I.e. the ones which all other gates are made up from - NOT and AND. In fact the universal gates (the ones that all other gates can be made from) are just NAND or NOR. 
            - In practice NANDs are easier to make so modern circuitry is just billions of NAND gates.
        - The Quantum NOT Gate (X Gate)
            - The NOT or X (in quantum computing) gate does exactly what you'd expect to the basis states
                - $$X(|0\rangle) = |1\rangle$$
                - $$X(|1\rangle) = |0\rangle$$
            - But of course in the quantum world we need to consider what a logic gate does to all qubit states
                - In the case of X gate it does something interesting and pretty simple (although imo not that intuitive)
                    - It flips the basises 
                    - $$X(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) = \alpha|1\rangle + \beta|0\rangle$$
            - Another way to look at quantum logic gates is the concept of a quantum wire. Which you read LTR as the passage of time
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fcamin%2FGgsz58NUU1.png?alt=media&token=e2bef71d-1097-428b-8c27-9158768975a4)
            - A third representation is as a 2x2 matrix
                -  $$ X = \begin{bmatrix} 0\  1 \\ 1 \ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
                - Sub in the matrix for the X symbol in $$X(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) = \alpha|1\rangle + \beta|0\rangle$$) and the math shakes out to be the operation we want
        - Quantum Wires
            - The NOT (X) gate seems like the simplest gate to implement but actually there is a simplier proposal - do nothing
                - $$|\psi\rangle ----- |\psi\rangle$$
            - We can this "gate" a Quantum Wire
            - Mathematically this is the simplest gate but practically it is the hardest to build
                - They are hard because qubits are extremely fragile states. That's not the say you couldn't fnd something (like a neutrino) which would be suitable, since it interacts with practically nothing. But in that case, they are not good candidates to be used in quantum gates.
                    - This tension between being resilient but fragile enough to alter is a common problem in quantum circuitry. 
        - Multi-Gate Quantum Circuit
            - Imagine a quantum circuit with 2 X gates. 
            - There are like 3 ways to figure out what's going to happen (it's pretty obvious)
                - You can remember to invert the basis twice = leaving you with the same equation
                - You can do the math and realise you end up where you started
                - Or you can notice $$XX(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) = I(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$
        - The Hadamard Gate (H Gate)
            - How it acts on the quantum basis states
                - $$H|0\rangle = \frac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle} {\sqrt2} $$
                - $$H|1\rangle = \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle} {\sqrt2} $$
            - More generally
                - $$H(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) = \alpha(\frac {|0\rangle + |1 \rangle} {\sqrt 2}) + \beta(\frac {|0\rangle - |1\rangle} {\sqrt 2})  $$
                - Factored out to show coefficients of the basis states
                    - $$H(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) = \frac {\alpha + \beta} {\sqrt 2} + \frac {\alpha - \beta} {\sqrt 2} $$
            - Just like the X gate the H gate has a matrix representation
                - $$\frac {1} {\sqrt 2} \begin{bmatrix} 1\   1 \\ 1 \ -1 \end{bmatrix}$$
            - Many quantum algorithms first use a Hadamard gate to "spread out" the quantum state before transformation which reduce the quantum state into something that perhaps cancels to one basis state, for example.
            - Note: $$HH = I$$, as with the X gate
            - Inverse H gate is the H gate. ==This is a more general mathematical concept, when you multiply two matrices that are the inverse of themselves with each other you get the Identity matrix==
            - 
        - Measuring a Qubit
            - The quantum state of any system is not directly observable. If I give you a qubit in a state $$\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$ you could not find out $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$
            - Can we get useful information out by __mesurement in the computational basis__
                - This is how we typically extract information from quantum computers
                - Lets say you have the state above.
                    - When you measure in the computational basis, the quantum system will collapse and yield one classical bit. 
                    - The probability of the system being observed in the $$|0\rangle$$ basis is $$|\alpha|^2$$ and $$|1\rangle$$ is $$|\beta|^2$$
                        - Remember the  Normalization Constraint  - this is why that applies - the probabilities need to sum to 1
                    - After the measurement $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ are gone. They were always hidden information
                    - An important implication of this is that you can't store an infinite amount of classical information in a qubit. 
            - Note that you can pass the qubit through a circuit to determine information about the state that you couldn't from measuring in the computational basis state alone. [See bottom](https://quantum.country/qcvc#measuring_a_qubit)
        - General Single Qubit Gates
            - In general a single qubit quantum gate is a 2x2  Unitary Matrix
            - X and H and I are Unitary 
            - Other Unitary Transformations
                - Wolfgang Pauli gave us the X gate but also the Y and Z gate.
                    - Collectively these are known as the __Pauli Matricies__
                    - They are crucial for quantum teleportation and for quantum error correction
            - The Y Gate
                - Very similar to the X gate but instead of 1's on the off diagonal there are i and -i
                - $$Y := \begin{bmatrix} 0\   -i \\ i\ 0\end{bmatrix}$$
                - Takes $$|0\rangle$$ to $$i|1\rangle$$ and $$|1\rangle$$ to $$-i|0\rangle$$
            - The Z Gate
                - $$Z := \begin{bmatrix} 1\   0 \\ 0 \ -1 \end{bmatrix}$$
                - Leaves $$|0\rangle$$ unchanged and takes $$|1\rangle$$ to $$-|1\rangle$$
            - Rotation is a perfectly valid quantum gate
                - $$\begin{bmatrix} cos(\theta)\   -sin(\theta) \\ sin(\theta) \ cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}$$
                - 
        -  Unitary Matrix
            - A unitary matrix is just one that __perserves the length of its inputs__
                - $$|| |\psi\rangle || = ||U|\psi\rangle ||$$
                - Indeed unitary matrices are the ==only matrices that preserve length this way==. See Why are Unitaries the only matrices which preserve length?
            - This much like a rotation or reflection matrix. In this sense a Unitary matrix is a complex generalisation of real rotations or reflections.
            - This is clearly crucial in quantum gates as the length of the input is normalised
            - In mathematical terms
                - given $$U^\dagger := (U^T)^*$$
                - Then $$U^\dagger U = I$$
                - The $$\dagger$$ operation is often called the __dagger operation__, __Hermitarian conjugation__ or just __conjugation__
                - $$ \begin{bmatrix} a\   b \\ c \ d \end{bmatrix}^\dagger = \begin{bmatrix} a*\   c* \\ b* \ d*\end{bmatrix}$$
            - Why are Unitaries the only matrices which preserve length?
                - Will revisit - math heavy 
        - The Controlled NOT Gate (CNOT)
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fcamin%2Fjva-_Z_FGe.png?alt=media&token=04ee1512-108c-462a-8552-7a783abb0da1)
                - Top wire - the wire with the solid black dot is the __control__ qubit
                - Bottom wire - the wire with the larger unfilled circle is the __target__ qubit
            - There are now 4 computational basis states 
            - As with all quantum states, we also have the linear combinations
                - $$\alpha|00\rangle + \beta|01\rangle + \gamma|10\rangle + \delta|11\rangle$$
                - Coefficient are complex numbers as usual and
                - $$|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 + |\gamma|^2 + |\delta|^2 = 1$$
            - The action of the CNOT gate is as you might expect. With control bit in 0th position, if control bit is high then NOT target bit
                - $$|00\rangle \rightarrow |00\rangle$$
                - $$|01\rangle \rightarrow |01\rangle$$
                - $$|10\rangle \rightarrow |11\rangle$$
                - $$|11\rangle \rightarrow |10\rangle$$
                - This can be restated quite succinctly
                    - $$|x,y\rangle \rightarrow |x, y \oplus x \rangle$$ 
                        - Where $$\oplus$$ is addition modulo 2
            - This gate, as with all quantum gates it is unitary and it acts on a superposition of states
                - $$\alpha|00\rangle + \beta|01\rangle + \gamma|10\rangle + \delta|11\rangle \rightarrow \alpha|00\rangle + \beta|01\rangle + \gamma|11\rangle + \delta|10\rangle$$
            - Now up to now the CNOT gate is just the same as a "classical" gate but it can be combined with other quantum gates to do decidedly non-classical things
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fcamin%2Fn6TEm1nrYZ.png?alt=media&token=23baba5f-15f7-4ec3-9395-3a73e827578f)
                    - 2 qubit system in state $$|00\rangle$$ (you could also write this $$|0\rangle|0\rangle$$)
                        - Hadamard Gate puts the first qubit into superposition $$ \frac {|0\rangle + |1\rangle} {\sqrt2}$$ but has not effect on the other qubit. Therefore the total effect is $$\frac {|00\rangle + |10\rangle} {\sqrt2}$$
                        - CNOT gate will leave $$|00\rangle$$ alone but will act on $$|10\rangle \rightarrow |11\rangle$$
                        - End result is $$\frac {|00\rangle + |11\rangle} {\sqrt2}$$
                        - This is an entangled state
                    - A general point for multi qubit state problems is:
                        - If we have single-qubit states 
                            - $$\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$ and
                            - $$\gamma|0\rangle + \delta|1\rangle$$
                        - Then when these states are combined, they are multiplied out as follows
                            - $$(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle)(\gamma|0\rangle + \delta|1\rangle) = \alpha\gamma|00\rangle + \alpha\delta|01\rangle + \beta\gamma|10\rangle + \beta\delta|11\rangle$$
                - 
            - CNOT leaves the control qubit alone, and modifies the target qubit. That’s true in the computational basis. In reality it is possible for the target qubit to affect the control qubit.
                - Proof
                    - Define
                        - $$|+\rangle = \frac {|0\rangle + |1\rangle} {\sqrt2}$$
                        - $$|-\rangle = \frac {|0\rangle - |1\rangle} {\sqrt2}$$
                    - Assign $$|+\rangle$$ as the control qubit and $$|-\rangle$$ as the target qubit 
                    - Result, after CNOT gate is both qubits will be $$|-\rangle$$
                        - i.e. the target qubit didn't change but the control qubit did.
                    - Math isn't hard, just remember A general point for multi qubit state problems is:
                        - Then prove after combining and CNOTing, it's equiv to two $$|-\rangle$$ qubits combined
            - 
            - 
    - Part III: Universal Quantum Computing
        - 3 steps of quantum computation
            - 1. Start in a computational basis state
            - 2. Apply as sequence of CNOT and single qubit quantum gates
            - 3. To obtain the result, measure in the computational basis. The probability of any result is the square of the absolutely value of the corresponding 
        - Gates which are multiples of the Identity Matrix
            - $$\begin{bmatrix} e^{i\theta} \ 0 \\ 0\ e^{i\theta} \end{bmatrix} = e^{i\theta} I$$
                - When $$\theta$$ is a real number, this is a unitary matrix, and therefore a valid quantum gate
                - The number $$ e^{i\theta} $$ is called the __global phase factor__
                    - The net effect of these gates, possibly with different $$\theta$$ will be to multiply the state output by $$e^{i\theta_1 + i\theta_2 + ... + i\theta_n}$$
                    - This does not change the squared amplitudes of the computational basis states, therefore it does not make a difference to the measurement probabilities at the end of the calculation
                    - This means you can be blase about unitary gates e.g. you don't need to differentiate between X and -X gate (since -X is X followed by -I). These gates X and -X are said to be the same __up to a global phase factor__. However there are certain algorithms where you would want to multiply by -1 for example.
