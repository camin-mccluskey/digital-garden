*What's the point: work out a razor for determining which of the 2 mindsets I want to be in at different times. OR determine a better mindset that is ultimately compatible with both (a meta mindset that brings this mental conflict into harmony)*

I find myself often stuck somewhere between 2 conflicting mindsets. 

1. "The attitude you take to this is the attitude you take to everything" mindset
2. The "bigger picture" mindset - done is better than perfect

Roughly I think this correlates to a quality vs. quantity mindset. What I really need is some way to determine the correct attitude to take at a given time, as I realise that each has it's time and place.

Maybe each has a common thread - they *think* they're optimising for the long term - but they go about it in different ways. To be very clear - the dichotomy is not short vs. long term. Both mindsets are compatible with the idea of optimising for long term value (which is consistent with my desired long term mindset (link habits/values)).

Benefits / Drawbacks of Each

High Standard

Bigger Picture


Failure Modes
- I just spend a whole day refactoring a filter component because I know it could be better 
- I just pushed code I know will cause a nightmare later - the more we build ontop of it the worse it's going to get 

Possible Razors
- How much contagion is this decision/work going to result in? (very tech debty approach)
