- Summary: Idea that respect is the thing to optimise for in cofounding relationships.


- {{[[table]]}}
    - Like but don't respect
        - Like and respect
    - Don't like and don't respect
        - Don't like but respect
- How much you like and how much you respect your cofounder are orthogonal axes
- Liking your cofounder is a fantastic but not sufficient 
- NB: Apply this to anyone you work with closely
- Examples of Quadrants
    - Like but don't respect - This is worse than respecting but not liking your cofounder. This is the friend that is fun to be around but whom you wouldn't trust to babysit.
    - Like and respect - this is the ideal zone - you are comfortable sharing a meal and a meeting room with this person. 
    - Don't like and don't respect - danger zone - avoid at all costs
    - Don't like but respect - politics could use more of this. You can respect people who stand for the opposite of your beliefs, indeed you can find their beliefs adhorent but still a) respect their right to have them b) respect their ability to defend them c) respect their respectfulness toward your belief. If the choice is between respecting and liking your cofounder - pick respect. If respect is mutual geniune affection can be built
        - [[Doug Leone]] has a [quote](https://twitter.com/yuris/status/1633680410155843584?s=20) here - about [[Mike Moritz]]
        - Other examples exist - [[Peter Thiel]] and [[Elon Musk]] quite famously - not sure if they ever figured it out while they were at [[Paypal]] though
- Counterbalancing - can you like and respect your cofounder __too__ much
    - Yes on both dimensions
    - Liking someone too much means you are in danger of "Ruinous Empathy" - [[Radical Candor - Kim Scott]]
    - Respecting someone too much [[Building a Successful Cofounder Team: A Psychological Starter Kit]] - passive, assertive and aggressive styles - with too much respect your default communication is passive. You don't see yourself as an equal partner and you therefore won't get treated like one
