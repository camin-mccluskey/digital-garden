- summary: Life is short, the task is long. Take your time. The article emphasises the [[Malcolm Gladwell]] take from [[Outliers - Malcolm Gladwell]], namely 10,000 hrs of [[Deliberate Practice]].


- Advice
    - Get **interested** in programming, not least because it helps the 10,000 hrs go by faster
    - Learn by doing - [[Metacognition]]
    - Talk with other programmers and read their code. This is **more important than any book**
    - If you want, go to college, at least for the credentials
    - Work on projects with other programmers. Be the worst programmer on some projects and the best on others
    - Work on projects __after__ other programmers. Learn how to read their code and fix it, learn how to write maintainable code you'd want to read
    - Learn at least **half a dozen** programming languages. Some OOP, some functional, some which emphasise syntactic abstraction (e.g. [[Lisp]]), one that supports declarative specifications (Prolog or C++ templates) and one that emphasises parallelism (like [[Clojure]] or [[Go]])
    - Remember there is computer in computer science. Know how long it takes for ops - [see](https://norvig.com/21-days.html)
