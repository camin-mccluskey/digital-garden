*Our lord and saviour demonstrating the right attitude to most software projects*

There is a pervasive idea that we shouldn't change what we don't understand. This is wrong in most (software) projects. Unless you're writing code that flies planes or runs nuclear reactors, if you have reasonable confidence the expected value is positive you should make your changes.

// todo - extend this essay to much more than software.

Why?
How?
- Before: Have guard rails: Make sure your LSP is working, utilise refactoring tools, have tests in place
- During: Splice up your changes: Even if this takes longer it means you can move with confidence 
- After: Release with Feature flags, release to a small amount of traffic, create the right culture (even with yourself - failure is ok, as long as learnings can be extracted).
