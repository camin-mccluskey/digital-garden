- Summary: __A core component of making great decisions is understanding the rationale behind previous decisions. If we don’t understand how we got “here,” we run the risk of making things much worse.__


- Chesteron's Fence is a heuristic inspired by a [[Quotes]] from the writer and polymath [[G.K. Chesterton]] in his 1929 book __The Thing__
    - __There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”__
    - A favourite of JFK
- In it's most concise form - ==Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place==
- The reasons that something exist may be more complex and nuanced than we first expect
- 2nd Order Thinking 
    - Second ordering thinking is the practice of not just considering the consequences of our decisions but also the consequences of the consequences
    - 1st order thinking is easy, 2nd order thinking is hard
- Why is the heuristic true?
    - Fences don't grow from nothing, nor do people build them out of madness or in their sleep.
    - They were built by people who had some reasoning behind their decision
    - Until we establish that reasoning we have no business dismantling the fence
    - Otherwise we end up with unintended circumstances - 2nd and 3rd order effects we don't want
- You can imagine this idea could be applied to anarchists and the current [[BLM]] movement. Their reasoning for dismantling the current order may seem valid but there are unintended consequences to their actions
    - In management the idea of "flat" organisational hierarchies might also be a good example. Sometimes there are benefits of having structure and reporting lines of communication
- Chesterton also alluded to the common belief that previous generations were fools, constructing fences where they fancied with no rationale
- Doing things the way we have done them means getting what we have always got
    - This statement is undoubtedly true
    - Even so we should not be overconfident about the redundancy of things we see as pointless
    - From evolution
        - A peacock's tail is not about efficiency, in fact it's entire value lies in it's inefficiency - [[Roy Sutherland]]
            - It signals the bird is healthy enough to grow it, increasing it's mating potential
            - If we cut it off and replaced it with a smaller, less visible tail we would have optimised for energy efficiency at the expense of mating potential. 
            - I think this is a good example of really deeply understanding the incentives (either revealed or hidden) behind decisions and actions.
                - In this example the incentive structure is explained by evolution - our genes want to propagate, this efficiency/attractiveness tradeoff is worth it, in other cases it may not be.
    - Habit
        - If you have a bad habit, it's admirable to want to eliminate it, however habits don't appear out of nowhere
        - This is why quitting a habit is much harder than replacing it with something else
            - This is the core message of [[The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg]]
            - To change a habit, focus on changing your reaction to a cue. This is effective and doesn’t require the same willpower as correcting yourself each time you fall into the habitual behaviour (willpower is a precious resource). Examine procrastination from the habitual framework perspective
- Chesterton's Fence is not an admonishment of anyone who tries to make improvements; it is a call to be aware of 2nd order thinking before intervening
    - Unless we know why someone made a decision, we can't safely change it or conclude that they were wrong
    - Advice: The first step is to understand a system, observe it in full, see how it interconnects with others aspects, learn how it all works, __then__ propose the change.
