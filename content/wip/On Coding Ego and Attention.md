- Summary: Learning how to get out of my own way by learning about the link between ego and attention. Applies beyond coding but is certainly relevant to the lack of motivation/attention I sometimes feel. View learning as pedals on a bike, gain momentum by flipping between knowing and not knowing.

- Meta-Level Coding
    - Coding is about making observation and identifying the relationships. These obvservations result in little hypotheses tests to be conducted
    - On the days where we're doing this smoothly, problem solving is effortless, the size and complexity of the problem makes no difference. You can just push on tattling each little roadblock by debugging H0
    - On bad days the opposite is true
    - Brown says - "its not about what I know, but rather what I think" that separates good and bad days
        - 2 Questions
            - 1. How can I have more good days than bad days?
            - 2. What exactly am I doing differently on my bad days?
- The Metacognition of Coding
    - Ego - The Number 1 Distractor
        - Most of the focus is on __external distractors__ - phones, netflix etc
            - These are manageable distractions
        - The biggest distractor is with me all the time, its in my head, its ego = [[Ego Distraction]]
            - Ego creates a tight bond between my work and my identity. It links self worth to job performance
            - As soon as we start work on anything that matters to me the scoring starts and the distraction begins
            - I find this problem - suddenly I'd rather work on an easier problem, get up and read a book, grab a snack. Anything to escape tackling the problem head on. Following this is a feeling of regret and remorse. "I should have figured this out by now", "why are you so stupid", "someone else would be done by now"
        - This kind of ego distraction pushes off hard things to buy temporary relief from the percieved threat to my ego
- [[Relative Deprivation Theory]]
    - Theory - Top students convince everyone else to stop trying. Or great engineers convince the rest to stop trying.
    - This concept shows the power of [[Ego Distraction]]
    - [[Malcolm Gladwell]]
        - Found when looking at STEM degree completion rates that **regardless of the prestigiousness of the university, the graduation rate is a constant"**
        - Why don't the smarter schools produce more graduates and the dumber schools less?
        - He found that __"Persistence in STEM is not simply a function of cognitive ability - it is a function of your relative standing in your class"__
    - Essentially self comparison with your peers determines the level of effort you put in 
- Taming Ego Distraction
    - [[Mental Models]] 
        - Shoshin
            - Zen Buddist idea which translates to "Beginner's Mind"
            - Beginner's mind is about rejecting the expert mindset and embracing life as a life long student
            - The problem with expertise isn't how much you know, that is obviously good. It's the rate of improvement drop that comes from being very good 
                - With more expertise comes judgement and expectations. We start to make predictions about reality which we need to invest our ego in proving to be true, rather than letting reality surprise us as a beginner would. 
                    - This is called [[Motivated Reasoning]]
                        - We start to ignore evidence that doesn't align with our expert judgment. 
            - It seems like being an expert is about knowing a lot of things. But actually pros just shorten the feedback loop between not knowing and knowing. 
        - Trying to avoid making mistakes activates motivated reasoning and actually lengthens the loop. This is the cost of ego distraction
        - Having a beginner's mindset is a powerful tool because knowledge is infinite and keeping score is pointless. Instead be willing to fail quickly and learning quickly. 
- Scientific Method
    - [[Quotes]]
        - "Modern science is backed on the Latin injunction __ignoramus__ -' we do not know' ... No concepts, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge" - [[Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari]]
    - Learning is just cycling between knowing and not knowing, like pedals on a bike
    - **Mastery is simply the accumulation of momentum not the accumulation of knowledge"**
        - When you pedal, you flip between not knowing and knowing and it gets easier as you go
        - To think that speed is being "accumulated" is to think you can stop pedalling and maintain speed. This is false. But such is the expert mindset
- Putting Task at the Center
    - The ego's trick is always the same - put me at the center. Make it personal. 
    - I must go from the personal to the impersonal 
        - "My problem" -> "The problem"
        - "My pull request" -> "The pull request"
    - Bring back the fun of when I first learn't to code
