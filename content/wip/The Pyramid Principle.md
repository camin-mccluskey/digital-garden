- Summary: Talk given by EF COO as part of EF LD16. The Pyramid Principle simply urges you to start comms with a punchline and rigorously justify each point.


- Why Communication Matters
    - Communication is a skill
        - You ablity to communicate is visible to everyone, everyday
        - As a founder in a remote world, this matters more than ever
        - Cofounders, Customers, Investors - these 3 groups will need to listen, understand and be convinced
    - People naturally tend to communicate in a way that doesn't help (inverted pyramid)

        - Detail > Clarifications > Conclusion (punchline)
        - This puts a really high cognitive load on people listening. The audience doesn't know what to focus on when you're talking.
- The Pyramid Principle
    - A framework for structured communication
        - Your listener wants to understand
            - What you're doing
            - Why they should listen
            - What you want from them
        - ...as quickly as possible
            - "Is this worth my time"
            - "When will they get to the point"
        - ...and direct the conversation where they see fit
            - "Once I understand, I'll know what questions to ask"
    - The Principle
        - {{[[drawing]]}}
        - 1) A clear statement - the puncline
        - 2) Arguments - The justifications for the punchline
            - MECE: Mutually exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
        - 3) Evidence
            - Time is always scarce, let your audience "self serve" to guide you to the parts of the pyramid they're interested in
    - Using the pyramid principle is an EF norm. Use it for:
        - IC Prep
        - VP checkins
        - Investor meetings 
    - Structuring
        - You can structure the pyramind like a memo
            - Headline (punchline)
                - Sub headline (argument)
                    - Evidence
                    - Evidence
                - Sub headline
                    - Evidence
                - Sub headline 
                    - Evidence

    - Tips and Pitfalls
        - Strong foundations
            - Does each row support the claim above it? Check for holes. IFTT
        - Minimal Viable Detail - "MVD"
            - Do you have spurious detail? Focus on what's important
        - Be Precise
            - Does the logic follow? Is the claim contensable? Will your audience interpret it to mean the same as you?
            - "The market is large" - to who?? State the number, at least now we can have a debate.
        - Test your logic: top, down; bottom, up
- Activity: Put it into practice
    - Punchline: "You should buy shares in Tesla"
        - What is the market doing - supply side, market undervalues Tesla
            - Battery minerals are getting cheaper
            - EU regulation is pushing Electric vehicles - UK, California
        - What are consumers doing - focus on consumer demand
            - 78% of millennials are interested in getting an EV at some point
            - Tesla is the preeminent EV brand
        - What are Tesla themselves doing
            - Data advantage in FSD
            - Superior R&D
            - Tesla have an advantage infrastructure
