- Tech has a generalised mistrust for journalism. Founders trust other founders, in the same way founders trust founder VCs over career VCs - https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1469547133875408907?s=20
    - I wonder how you solve for the distribution problem 
- Given that the current discourse claims that individual differences are only as a result of broken systems, systemic discrimination etc, then there must be opportunities in understanding that there **are indeed individual differences between people**
    - Opportunities in prediction where individual differences are a factor - e.g. [predictive policing](https://twitter.com/JuliaAngwin/status/1466397110027313154?s=20)
    - Opportunities in investment where individual differences are a relevant input - e.g. financial investment, gambling (?), schooling

- Criteria for next business idea - the problem is...
    - [ ] Faced by a target market every single day
    - [ ] Affects a lot of people 
    - [ ] These people are crying out for a solution to this problem 
- Criteria for the solution(s) to that problem:
    - [ ] We can build something today that can immediately solve the problem better than the alternative. We are aware that the alternative may well be doing nothing, the second alternative may be something offline or a spreadsheet
    - [ ] It is a "cure" not a vitamin for the problem
    - [ ] It is a software solution
- The null hypothesis is that every idea is wrong, every product idea is flawed
    - How can we increase the confidence with which we reject the null hypothesis?

- Wicked Problems
    - In planning and policy, a **wicked problem** is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize.

    - I find it easy enough to gather up some data and sort of "brain dump" it onto a noteapp, like Roam research but it takes a lot of motivation and patience to structure the final product into something that's a narrative
        - I need like a ghost writer/editor that does the actual prose, let me come up with the ideas and sort of link them into a narrative I want to tell
        - Also sometimes I'm not even sure what the narrative is, I'm just writing down interesting points that seem somewhat related - idk where the essay or document is going to go yet.
- Problems that businesses certainly face:
    - Staying on top of public mood and perception

        - What is our public perception? How can we shift public perception of our brand?
- Start-up School Ideas
    - [Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas](http://paulgraham.com/bronze.html)
        - Its common for a group of founders to go through a lame idea before realising they need to make something people actually want
            - PG had a company before ViaWeb that put art galleries on the internet
            - Paul Allen and Bill Gates had a company before Microsoft
        - Why do good hackers have bad business ideas?
            - 1. The "Still Life" Effect - Plunging into an idea
                - If you're going to spend years working on something, it makes sense to at least spend a few days thinking about it, and considering different ideas
                - Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small projects
                - PG calls this the "still life" problem
                    - You draw a couple of quick sketches then you're so keen to start painting you sink hours and days into it. At each point realising it's already been too long to stop now
                - "Plunging" into an idea shouldn't be discarded 
                    - The problem is at the other end - realise that just because you've spent time on an idea, doesn't make it good
                    - You need to ask two questions constantly
                        - Is this something people will pay for?
                        - Of all the things we could make, is this the thing people will pay the most for?
            - 2. Muck - making something cool over something useful
                - The purpose of a startup is to make money. You need to have that front of mind constantly
                - The ideal is definitely make money and maybe be cool NOT be cool and maybe make money
                - It's hard enough to make money that you can't do it by accident. Unless it's your first priority, it's unlikely to happen at all
            - 3. Timidity
                - You need to commit 100% to the idea and to the business
                - It's easy to be scared off, in reality no one knows that they are doing and big companies have too much to worry about to be concerned with you
                - A big source of fear is "business"
                    - Hackers are fine with programming, its the other stuff that's scary
                    - At lot of it is O(1) scary or hard
        - Of the 3 kinds of problems, the first one is the most common. 
        - ==Reading the WSJ for a couple of weeks should give you 2-3 ideas for startups that could make money.==
            - The articles are full of in-depth descriptions of problems that need to be solved
        - The source of this main problem is something that is echoed in [[Zero to One - Peter Thiel]]
            - Specifically Incrementalism 
            - People are good at solving problems but they are not good at finding them
            - This comes down to how things are graded essentially
        - A good source of inspiration in this area is [[How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie]]
            - Essentially you need to learn to see things from the POV of others
        - This essay inspired the YC slogan ==Make something people want==.
    - [How to Get Startup Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)
        - The way to get startup ideas is not to look for them, instead look for problems - perferrably ones you have yourself
        - The best ideas have 3 things in common
            - They're something the founders themselves want
            - They are something the founders can build themselves
            - They are something that few others realize are worth doing
        - All of this is to guard against the problems in [Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas](http://paulgraham.com/bronze.html)
            - It ensures you MAKE SOMETHING PEOPLE WANT!!!
            - People build stuff noone wants because they have "Sitcom Ideas"
                - Those that sound plausible but are actually flawed
        - The dangers of Sitcom Ideas
            - The danger is that when you run it by people they say "I'd maybe use this" or "I could see myself/someone else using this"
            - Sum that reaction across the population and you have something no one will use
        - When a startup launches they need to have at least some users who really need what the startup makes
            - Not just people who might use it some day
            - Usually this number is small because if there was a large group of people who could benefit from something that took a couple of programmers a couple of months to hack together it would already exist
                - This means you need to compromise on one dimension
                    - Either make something a large number need a little bit or make something a small number need a lot
                    - ==Choose the latter!!==
                    - Made up ideas are the former
                    - Dig out a deep well of demand, not just a shallow carve 
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fcamin%2FmlRZtYgUZ2.png?alt=media&token=41212523-8756-47b6-a671-be6b7fe04461)
                    - You need to think of something that people need so much they'll accept a crappy version made by a 2 person startup no one has heard of
                        - If the idea isn't that, it's probably bad
                    - The narrowness of the well is really just an artefact of the deepness, obviously it would be deep and wide but then if that were the case, it probably already exists
        - A Path Out
            - This is related to [[The Innovator's Dilemma - Clayton M. Christensen]]
            - You need a path from a small, highly motivated early user group, to a wider group of people
            - How do you tell if a path exists?
                - Often you can't - AirBnB had no idea how big the idea was to become
                - Often this is the role of a VC - to identify the path then the founders can't
            - How can you pick between ideas if you can't see a path out?
                - If you're the right sort of person, your hunches will be correct 
                - Note: if this is the case, we do need to be thinking about paths at the idea stage, I hadn't really considered this tbh
                - ==Empirically to have good startup ideas you need to be the sort of person who has them==
        - ==Empirically to have good startup ideas you need to be the sort of person who has them==
            - Leading the field as a creator or as a user (Mark Zuckerberg blogged about his life constantly but most others wouldn't have seen how comfortable people would become sharing their life online)
            - Living the the future
                - [[Quotes]] 
                    - "Live in the Future and build what's missing" - Paul Buchheit
            - Generally speaking most successful startups are external stimuli hitting a prepared mind
                - The verb used most at YC is "notice" rather than "thought of" w.r.t. ideas
                    - YC calls these "organic ideas"
                - Luck favours the prepared mind
            - While "being the sort of person to have good ideas, or having a prepared" isn't a recipe for startup ideas, it sort of is. It just takes a year rather than a weekend to prepare the mind in the right way
        - Noticing Ideas
            - Live in the future and look for things that are missing
                - Look for the obviously missing things, apply the filter "could this be a big company later"
                - Most things that a missing take a while to notice. It is frustrating but this is the ideas behind Secrets. People act like there are none to find but they necessarily must be out there.
                    - You need to turn off the filters preventing you from seeing them
                        - Status-quo filter 
                            - Do not take the world for granted 
                                - Pay particular attention to the things that are annoying right now. The status quo bias exists because
                                    - it makes life easier if you don't question everything
                                    - it makes life more tolerable - if you knew what you were missing out on from the future it would be annoying
                            - When you find the right sort of problem it should be obvious at least to you
                                - This is the paradox - you need to see something that's obvious but something that is overlooked up to this point. This is very similar to the question "What is one thing that you know to be true that everyone disagrees with you on?"
                            - Probably the best approach is to keep working on interesting problems while always keeping a background process going, looking for gaps and anomalies 
                                - ==Give yourself time==
                                - Lots of entrepreneurs worked on bad ideas for a bit, or at least considered them, it's worth giving it more thought 
                            - Another trick to notice gaps is to ==work on projects that seem cool or interesting. If you worked on something that already existed it probably wouldn't be much fun==
                                - Often working on "toys" is a profitable route to a good idea. People dismiss ideas as toys
                        - Shlep Filter
                            - Everyone wants to write some nice code and be done.
                            - The reality is, if any idea existed that could be solved like that, it would have been solved in the very early days
                            - ==Look for the messy, tedious ideas and you'll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented==
                            - Stripe is the classic example. Everyone hated dealing with online payments but the whole market was "too messy" to try to fix
                            - Often Shlep isn't as bad as you'd think because:
                                - The reality often isn't as bad as it seems
                                - You might have a comparably easier time in other domains where startups typically struggle, like user acquisition 
                        - Unsexy Filter
                            - Very similar to the Shlep Filter except it prevents you from working on the problems you despise rather than the ones you fear.
                            - ==Turning off the ((zzxuDA5Va)) is more important that turning off the unsexy filter==
                                - Because what looks like a slog is more likely to be an illusion and starting a startup if laborious no matter what the idea is
                                - Working on a sexy idea might be somewhat correlated with value, since that's likely to be at the cutting edge of the field, plus you'll work on it more enthusiastically if you find the problem interesting
        - A clash of domains
            - Mixing domains can be a source of ideas. As software engineers might see opportunities where experts in the field don't. Plus, since you are not an expert you are not burdened by received wisdom. Just watch out of dunning-kuerger 
        - Just build
            - You don't have to turn everything into a startup. Just build interesting stuff and worry about the startup part later. It's premature optimization
        - PG and [[Peter Thiel]] sort of clash on the idea of competition 
            - PG advocates not being scared of competition - in fact its a good sign
            - You just need to have a thesis on why everyone else is wrong. 
            - I guess I can square their world views if you define being right when others are wrong as the sort of Last Mover Advantage , Last Mover Advantage
            - The best way to be right when others are wrong is to follow through on what imcumbants would have done if they were scared or stuck to their original principles
        - Coming up with Ideas
            - While "noticing" rather than "thinking of" is preferable there are some ways to come up with ideas 
            - Be aware that if you need to come up with ideas quickly there is a far larger chance that you'll encounter lots of bad ones. So more filtering is required 
            - Recipes
                - Look in areas where you have expertise 
                    - You might struggle to think of ideas in the areas where you have a lot of knowledge. The reality is your ideas in other domains are just as bad, you're just giving yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass 
                - Look for things you __need__
                    - "Why doesn't someone make X"
                - Ask people what they __need__
                    - This is the next best thing to Look for things you __need__
                    - The best way is to make their problems, your problems
                - Don't just turn off your filters but look for Shleps and Unsexy problems to solve
                    - A trick is to ask what is hard and annoying right now that you'd just pay someone to do for you. Create that company
                - Look for companies/industries that are dying and ask who would profit from their demise
                    - But imagine asking that question in the future, not now
                    - Be imaginative on what axis the replacement occurs
                - Start with a market that the big companies couldn't serve profitably 
                    - Look for the hobbyist 
                    - They are underserved and enthusiastic 
                - Remember with recipes that you run the risk of The dangers of Sitcom Ideas
    - [Ideas for Startups](http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html)
        - Why do people think it's hard to come up with ideas?
            - People actually say "I don't have any ideas" - they haven't really tried to think of anything
            - The impression is that it is hard because comapnies are worth billions
                - but the value of the idea != the value of the company
                - Proof of this is that there is no marketplace for ideas for startups - implying they are not, by themselves, valuable
        - Start with Questions
            - Most ideas don't end up being anything like the initial idea
                - In fact its generally when fixing what's broken with the first attempt that the real idea comes
            - The initial idea is a jumping off point
                - Instead stating what you want to build,  ask if it's possible to build it
                - A question isn't as challenging, it is by definition not a statement of fact, it gives you scope to be wrong and explore
        - One valuable way to for idea to be wrong is to be a partial solution to a problem.
        - 2 Ingredients for ideas
            - Be aware of new technologies 
            - Have the right sort of friends
                - Ideas form when discussing what's wrong with them
                - PG thesis on why so few female founders
                    - % hackers that are female < % hackers that are men
                    - Startups generally have 2+ founders, founders are likely to be friends, friends are more often than not the same sex = small % squared
        - Doodling
            - Letting your mind wander is doodling with ideas
                - It's like calling a function with random arguments and seeing what happens
                    - Nice aside - "A metaphor is just calling functions with the wrong sort of arguments"
                - This works when the stimulus is hitting a prepped mind
            - If new ideas arise like doodling, this explains why you need to work for a while before you have any
                - You need these "habits of the mind" already ingrained to sort of iterate off of
                    - Sources for habits of the mind
                        - Hard fields - since hard fields require "hard solvents" - i.e. robust mental models and concepts
                        - Fields with are related but in unexpected ways - i.e. everyone knows CS and Physics are linked so novel ideas across those fields are hard to find
        - Problems
            - In theory you could stick ideas together at random - Uber for Dogs
                - It's going to be hard to find anything useful this way though
            - Good ideas don't come about at random, it helps if you're working on a problem first
                - It's harder to see problems than solutions - since we spend a lot of life filtering out problems to make life bearable
            - Recipe:
                - Finding a problem intolerable and thinking "There must be a way to fix this"
        - Wealth
            - The difference between good ideas and good startup ideas is the potential to make money
                - There are very close though - so much so that you are best off just discovering and evaluating a good idea, then stopping after to wonder if there is any way to make money
            - Tactics:
                - Look at what people use that is broken right now. They'd use it/pay for it more if it wasn't so broken
                - Turn luxuries in commodities - If people are willing to pay for it at that price, widen the pool
                    - Model T is a lesson - you will need to be ruthless at understand the core essence - "Any color as long as it's black" 
        - Design For Exit
            - Its not a bad thing to start out with the intention that you want to be aquired
                - 98% of the time that's what an exit is. Very few startups go public
            - In that case look at what big companies should be doing and just solve that for them 
            - Just make sure its something multiple companies need - otherwise there is no market, they can take as long as they want and just copy it

    - [How to Succeed With a Startup - Sam Altman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lJKucu6HJc)
        - Make a product so good people will tell their friends about it
            - This is the number one thing, the only thing that really matters. This is 80% of the work necessary 
            - You product needs to be easy to explain
                - If people don't get it, your thinking is unclear or the need isnt there
        - Target a market which is growing exponentially, or about to grow exponentially
            - Ride the TAM elevator
        - Identity fake vs. real trends
            - Real trends are one where the early adopters use the product obsessively and tell their friends about it.
            - The iPhone didnt sell that well early on but the people who bought it absolutely loved it
                - Then was a good time to start looking into making mobile apps
        - Evangelical Founder
            - Usually the CEO 
            - This person needs to infect, with enthusiasm, the entire world
        - Ambitious Vision
            - Let yourself grow more ambitious visions over time
            - Start a hard startup not an easy one
                - Its so much more inspiring that paradoxically, it's easier
                - Easier to hire The first 4 or 5 people might be attracted by large equity stakes or high-profile responsibilities but the real question to ask is "why would the 20th employee join this company?"
                - People want to be associated with an inspiring vision
        - Confident and Definite view of the future
            - "This is what is going to happen" - have courage in your convictions
        - Huge if it works
            - The whole startup ecosystem is set up to support startups with a low chance of success, but are huge if they work
        - Team
            - The team you build is the company you build
            - What do you need
                - Optimists
                    - the entire world will be telling you, you will fail. You need the spirit of optimism on your team
                - Idea Generators
                    - you dont want too many but enough, enough to iterate to success
                - "We'll figure it out"
                    - the situations that startups tend to win in, are ones that are incredibly dynamic
                - "I've got it"
                    - You need owners. As PG says - you need people who are above the jobs they do, just getting on with it
                - Bias for Action
                    - You will always have too little data - you need people who act and react 
                - Benefit of Inexperience
                    - You can take more bets because no one told you you couldn't do this
        - Momentum 
            - Startups survive on their own momentum
            - Keep winning, keep learning
            - Founders need to keep their foot on the gas
        - Competitive Advantage
            - Plan to be a monopoly 
        - A Sensible Business Model
            - You don't need to have it all figured out but you need some ideas
        - Distribution Model
            - Again don't need to have it all figured out, but some ideas are crucial
        - Frugality, Focus, Obsession, Love
            - You need to have these traits
        - Why Startups Win
            - One No vs. One Yes
                - if you are a PM at a big company one "no" can kill you
                - if you're at a startup you only need one investor to say "yes" and you're in business
                - because great ideas look bad but are good you only need one "yes"
            - Fast-Changing Markets
                - Your agility is a huge benefit
            - Platform Shift
                - After mobile apps because a thing, lots of new startups because huge
                - Big companies can't operate on the cadence necessary to adapt to shifting norms. If the world looks different today than yesterday a startup can just get to work, a big company cannot.

        - The Problem
            - Characteristics
                - Popular - lots of people have it. Ideally millions of people
                - Growing - the market is growing. More and more people are about to have it. Ideally 20%/yr +
                - Urgent  - People want to solve it today. Ideally right now this second
                - Expensive -  Ideally $B
                - Mandatory - The problem just has to be done. Ideally a law change
                - Frequently - encountered over and over again. Ideally hourly (at least multiple times a day)

                - Market
                    - Is it growing 20%+/yr
                    - This is super weak b/c [[Competition is for Losers - Peter Thiel]]
                        - No macroeconomic trend is so powerful that you can be successful by merely participating in it
                - Product
                    - Must be at least $$\gt10$$x on some importnant domain
                - Aquisition
                    - $0. You need to be acquiring users by word of mouth primarily
                - Monopoly
                    - Boolean
                    - As you grow do you get stronger. Are you building a moat
        - Beliefs
            - 2 Types
                - Threshold
                    - Can we build it?
                    - Can we actually sell anything?
                - Miracle
                    - If we build it will be revolutionary
        - Examples
            - Y Combinator
                - Problem: Hard for founders to find investors without knowing someone personally in VC
                - Solution: YC invests in companies through an open application
                - Unfair Advantages
                    - Founders: Incredible experience at a time when most did not understand the tech industry
                    - Market: Future $B companies would be technology/software startups. Software startups need less $
                    - Product: Covering 3 months living expenses is enough. Hackers want to do this. No coworking space is better. Other angels/VCs want to invest in these startups
                    - Acquisition: PC wrote books and online essays with a large audience of target users: hackers
                    - Monopoly: Alumni network more valuable than partners. Easier to recruit. Scales advice. Better beta. Branding
            - Wufoo
                - Problem: Websites need to collect custom information. This requires code 
                - Solution: Wufoo is a WYSIWGG editor with no code
                - Market: Almost every website needs to collect data 
                - Product: Product was 10x faster that code tools. 100x cheaper/faster than hiring someone
                - Acquisition: Started with 100k developers subscribed to a blog. The forms themselves were branded so network effects.

            - Where can you provide a benefit to users a benefit where other existing companies cannot
                - How can you differentiate your product
            - Don't worry about  TAM - this is basically impossible 
                - Just make sure the estimate is realistically huge!
        - What doo you measure early on

            - if usage per cohort keeps declining
                - Unless there is a lower bound, total usage will tend to zero
                - Even if total useage is increasing, if cohort useage is declining, you're pretty fucked
                    - Don't build a fad 
                    - Measure and foster repeat useage
                - If cohort usage is increasing over time you're in a good spot

            - This is what you need
            - Measure your rate of growth / week
            - Aim to keep this growing. This is really hard
        - Iteration Speed
            - Speed is the main advantage that startups have over established companies
            - Actually measure your rate of iteration
            - Make sure you're iterating in the right direction - use metrics to determine this
        - Make metrics seriously but remember they are a proxy for the underlying value
        - Reality can be painful
            - Metrics reduce delusion but sometimes that hurts

        - The Idea
            - The goal of a startup is to build something users love
                - It's much better to have something that a small number of users love, rather than something a larger number of users sort of like
            - To have a successful startup you need
                - A great idea (including a great market)
                - A great team
                - A great product
                - Great execution
            - What YC looks for
                - What are you building and why?
                    - Clear concise answers only
                        - founders need to be clear in their communication annd demonstrate they are solving a real problem
                - Why do the founders want to start this company?
                    - You need a shared sense of mission
                - Who desperately needs the product?
                    - In the best case you yourself are the target user. Second to, you know the target user group well
                    - If you have users are they referring friends - why not?
                    - If you dont have users - how are you working backwards from the ideal vision to the kernel of an idea what solves most of the problem?
                - How will you become a monopoly?
                    - In the [[Peter Thiel]] sense of the word
                    - What moat are you building? How do you get more powerful with scale?
                - The market?
                    - How big is it today?
                    - How fast is it growing?
                    - What do you understand about the shifts happening today that no one else does?
                    - What small market are you going to dominate then scale from?
            - Prefer something new and hard to derivative and easy
                - People want to join you, you have more to gain if you win
            - The best ideas sound bad but are, in fact, good
                - Get used to rejection
                - Get used to hearing the idea sucks
            - It's so much better if you have an idea and a startup is just a way to get that idea out into the world
                - Don't chase ideas just to start a startup
                - Good founders have too many ideas
                - When you start a company then search for an idea there is a bias against risk
                    - It leads to People build stuff noone wants because they have "Sitcom Ideas"
                - Instead practice noticing problems
                    - Look for technological shifts

                    - At some point ideas will emerge
- To what extent does path dependency lock us into suboptimal outcomes 
    - why do we have office buildings still? Why doesn't everyone work from home?
    - what are the important pieces of history in a given industry? When we set those in context do we see where we made a good local optimisation step (or even not tbh) but a bad choice in terms of finding the global optima

        - Personal Kanban (works for me)
        - GTD method
    - But these methods fall down when you rely on others to get shit done to unblock you. 
    - I have no visibility into whether I am dropping a time sensitive issue on someone who has no bandwidth or if I am pressuring someone to complete something that doesn't really matter, which they are prioritising above work that does matter to the org

- [How to build great products](https://www.defmacro.org/2013/09/26/products.html)
- [[The Artist and the Innovator - Ash Maurya]]
    - Building great products is hard - you need a [[Mental Models]] to analyse products and features
        - The 3 Bucket Model
            - Gamechangers
                - People will want to buy your product for this feature
            - Showstoppers
                - People won't buy your product if you're missing this feature, but adding it won't generate demand
            - Distractions
                - The feature will make no measurable impact on adoption
        - You need this model because time is finite. You can't just blindly add and remove features until you figure it out
            - This reframes the PM problem as a resource allocation problem
                - Putting effort into distractions = wasted resources
                - Too many showstoppers = wasted resource 
                - Too much effort into a given showstopper = wasted resources
                - More than 3 gamechangers = wasted resources
                    - Gamechangers are **hard**. 3 is stretch 
                - Not enough effort into a gamechanger = wasted resources
                    - You need to blow people away. Otherwise there is no point 
        - You don't need to be right all the time on this categorisation (and by extension what you build), you just need to be more right than your competitors
            - The best way to build this intuition is to talk to a lot of people
        - The sooner you talk to users, have a detailed history of the space, knowledge of the technology and direction of the compeition. The sooner you can form a coherent view of the space and develop a unique vision for your product. 
        - Beware of noise - learn the difference between the people signing the cheques and those just commenting 
            - A feature is only a game changer if the person paying recognises it as one
        - You need to eat sleep breathe and live as your uses do 
        - Avoid "gamechangers in aggregate"
            - Its tempting to add features such that when they all work together it's a gamechanger
            - This is dangerous for 3 reasons
                - It becomes harder to tell what combination of individual features is and isn't a gamechanger
                - It's expensive
                - Its easy to convince yourself that adding one more feature would make it a gamechanger
        - Write down a product mission to guide the categorisation process
            - Make sure it is information rich 
                - Example
                    - **Database tools should be indistinguishable from magic**
                    - Surprise and amaze people with developer tools for building real-time, data-driven web applications they could only dream of building, and bring sheer joy and simplicity to the process of building great software.

    - Maybe this looks more like a locker for multiple delivery companies. Kind of like a PO box system for small towns etc?
    - Pricing models
        - Delivery companies pay
        - User pays - if they're out they have to pay to release the package?
        - Option for users to choose this delivery type
    - How do users get their packages
        - Big enough that things can fit inside - what about really big things 
        - They can be released with their delivery number (i.e. it's not a fixed system, it'll just be whatever the company uses as their unique ID)
    - 
- Uber for deliveries
    - Extra flex and peak demand times 
    - Scaling back then there's less demand 
    - Uber for Amazon - Juxtaposition
- lambda school for apprentices - Juxtaposition
- The "like" is not the correct primitive for the social web 2.0

- Scientific journals - [[Stefan Grossfurthner]]
    - UCL Pays 10-12 million per year for access to journals
    - Scientific American - scientists spend far too much time applying for grants
- Personalised Learning Objectives
    - Problem: "I know vaguely what I want to achieve" - e.g. I'd like to be able to design a professional looking website, I'd like to understand how quantum computing works etc. 
        - But, I'm not sure how to get there. What is the trunk of this knowledge, what are implementation details, what resource are out there? I'd like a "roadmap" to navigate the knowledge/benchmark myself against. 
        - For an organisational L&D perspective
            - According to [LinkedIn’s Workplace Learning Report](https://learning.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/amp/learning-solutions/images/workplace-learning-report-2019/pdf/workplace-learning-report-2019.pdf), 74% of learners want the freedom to take training courses during their spare time, at their own pace. But among that very same group, 75% of respondents want their managers to recommend courses.

    - Pricing: 
    - Why Now: The rise of remote work and job displacement means that learning needs to happen more rapidly and flexibly to meet future demands.
    - Crucial Point:
        - Self directed learning != Self paced learning - self paced learning is in decline 
    - Market: Is this a billion dollar opportunity?
        - Deloitte estimates that workers need to spend 1% of their time on learning to stay current with developments in their field, in order to do their job effectively.

            - e-learning industry is worth $144Bn and expected to growth 14.6% YoY to 2026
                - There is a huge demand for E-learning as it can be customized according to one's pace of learning and understanding and it offers various tools that increase the engagement of the learners.
                - APAC  region is anticipated to a larger share of the E-learning market in the upcoming years.
                - Online Certificate and Professional course segments are seen as major driving segments of the market in the forecast period.
            -  Self paced learning is in decline however - [The Self-Paced eLearning Market Will Decline To $33.5 Billion By 2021](https://elearningindustry.com/top-elearning-statistics-2019)
                - Why: People don't complete their courses
                    - Why: They get bored
                        - Why: It's not engaging content
                        - Why: It's clearly out of date
                    - Why: They don't see the value in learning this stuff
                        - Why: There is no tangible outcome like a certificate
                        - Why: Their job/manager doesn't recognise the value in them learning this stuff
                        - Why: They don't see the application 
                    - Why: They don't have time 
                        - Why: Their job is busy enough as it is, when they get home from work they want to switch off
                        - Why: The programme is asking for too much of a commitment
                        - Why: Other prioritities come up 
                            - On this point, I find this to a huge extent. I'm super excited about learning something and then something else new and shiny comes up and replaces it. Like I was doing a Coursera Neuroscience course, really enjoying it then I realised I should look into gRPC and K8s for my job and it was really interesting for a bit, then I thought I should brush up on my iOS dev skills and now I've completely bailed on the Coursera course
                                - Q: How to we allow people to pivot their interests and progression. I wouldn't feel so bad about dropping the Neuroscience course if I was able to explicitly say - "my priorities shifted, I'll pick that back up later"
                    - Why: They forget about it 
                        - Why: Reminders go to busy work email
                        - Why: The Duolingo Owl gets annoying eventually -> delete app or silence notifcations

    - Hypothesis: Customers are overserved by airlines and underserved on their core desire - to travel cheaply and easily
    - Hypothesis: 'When' you go is so much more important than 'how' you go
    - Hypothesis: Limited bags is ideal, none is an annoyance
    - Hypothesis: Hidden fees are a turn off for travellers, they want to know exactly what they're buying
