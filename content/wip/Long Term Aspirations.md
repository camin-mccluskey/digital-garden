- [[Goals]]
- Summary: I need to have coherent High Level Concern(s) for living. This document captures my thinking around that and attempts to break the concern(s) down into meaningful goals which I can track through POKRs.


- Question to think about
    - Where do I see myself in 5 years?
        - Running a company which is successful
            - how do you measure success
                - we make something people need/want
                    - we are profitable 
                - we have a mission worth fighting for
                    - we have a significant number of employees
    - What gives me energy, what makes me happy and what is good for the world
    - In the long term how is the world changing, what will people need and want in the future. What needs are underserved?

- Favourite Problems
    - YC alum (Michael Seibel) says "keep a list of your favourite problems not your favourite ideas
    - I'm going to collect some of my favourite problems under this block
    - [Good article](https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/11/12-favorite-problems/)
        - Your favourite problems are a way to discover the ideas which align to your High Level Concern(s)
        - Think of your favorite problems as a set of receptors. They take in information, sort it into relevant applications, and allow you to apply your ideas in a much more focused way to achieve your purpose.
        - The secret is the problems can't be too broad or too specific
    - [[Quotes]]
        - __You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while, there will be a hit, and people will say, ‘How did he do it? He must be a genius!”__ - Richard Feynman
    - [[Social Media Is Broken]] <- good candidate
    - [[Teleportation]] <- too broad
    - [[Immortality]] <- too broad
- What do I see as my "life's work"? This is mentioned in [[Grit - Angela Duckworth]], there needs to be some overarching theme, some constant goals which the answer for "why?" is just because, that is my calling
- what dent do i want to make on the universe?
- What would I be willing to die trying to do?
    - what would bring me joy even if i never achieved it?
    - what would do "incremental good"?
- Explore this fundamental monologue that I am someone is, in some sense special. Does everyone feel like this?
    - No - some people are content with a "normal life".
    - I should not lose this drive but, this constant monologue without direct action is counterproductive. There is no point imagining a dream and only making tangental steps toward it. **If the life in my head is to be a reality I need to move more directly toward it.**
- [[Ikigai]]
    - Everyone has an ikigai - 'A reason to get up in the morning'. A reason to enjoy life.

        - How does this link into everything in this document?
- [[Zero to One - Peter Thiel]]
    - "What is one thing that you know to be true that everyone disagrees with you on?"
        - People don't value human interaction as much as they think they do. Once a suitable replacement comes along most people will rather do the activity on the toilet, on their phone
            - Online dating goes from something for lonely weirdos to tinder, and bumble
            - Question - what else is like this? What have we yet to break the barrier on?
                - Work is slowly getting there, covid has given it the kick it needed
                - Dating is all the way there basically
                - Sex is there
                - Family??
                - Friendship, mostly there 
                - News is all the way there (to its and the world's deterement)
        - Shopping is basically a commodity now, I don't really care who makes the product as long as I can get it from Amazon within a couple of days
    - Creating a monopoly. Going from 0 - 1 NOT 1 - n.
    - Definite Optimism (making an audacious bet on what the future will be like) over indefinite optimism (aka. keeping my options open)
- What are the Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs) I want to take on
    - BHAG is a concept developed in the book __Built to Last.__ A BHAG (pronounced “Bee Hag,” short for "Big Hairy Audacious Goal") is a powerful way to stimulate progress. A BHAG is clear and compelling, needing little explanation; people get it right away. Think of the NASA moon mission of the 1960s. The best BHAGs require both building for the long term AND exuding a relentless sense of urgency: What do we need to do today, with monomaniacal focus, and tomorrow, and the next day, to defy the probabilities and ultimately achieve our BHAG?
