- Summary: Creative output is like a dirty tap. When you first switch it on, bad water is going to flow out. You **must** leave it on. Eventually clean water will start to flow. Occasionally some dirty water will flow out but that's ok, you just keep it on until that's cleared and the clean water flows again.
